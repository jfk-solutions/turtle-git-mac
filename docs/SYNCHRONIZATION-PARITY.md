# Git Synchronization parity

Baseline: `7338078f8ddd924b8cddee35f512f2286072136d`, `SyncDlg.cpp`
(`FetchOutList`, `ShowInCommits`), its inline `AddDiffFileList` in `SyncDlg.h`,
and `Git.cpp::IsFastForward/GetCommitDiffList`, plus `BranchCombox.h`.
A partial native window now exposes the outgoing projection. This is not a
completed Synchronization dialog.

## Comparison backend

`GitRepository.synchronizationOutgoing` returns a pinned, read-only projection of
the local and remote-tracking revisions. Equal revisions produce Up to date with
no outgoing comparison. A missing remote branch produces the source unknown
branch state. The source's slash/backslash URL heuristic is retained: a typed URL
or path is unknown without contacting the server, even with Force enabled.

For a fast-forward push, the outgoing Log range is remote..local and the file
comparison is remote to local. Divergence without Force produces the blocked
state. Force keeps the remote..local Log range but compares files from the merge
base to local. The full history is requested, bypassing Log's ordinary 200-row
limit. File comparisons enable the source default 50-percent copy detection and
retain original paths. Existing other comparison callers keep their defaults.

An unusual pinned-source behavior is preserved: no merge base leaves a zero
CGitHash; GetCommitDiffList interprets zero as the working-copy revision. Forced
unrelated histories therefore keep outgoing commits and use working tree to local
for their file comparison. A forced behind branch can have zero outgoing commits
while still enabling Email Patch, just as the source does.

`synchronizationIncoming` compares the captured pre-operation revision with the
actual completed revision (HEAD after Pull, fetched upstream after Fetch), returning
that pinned comparison and old..new history. Equal revisions return empty lists.
Resolving hashes uses stdout independently of diagnostic output. Input NULs and
pre-cancelled operations are rejected; the token is forwarded through Git reads.
The snapshots do not authorize transport operations.

## Native outgoing window

The TurtleGit menu opens a retained per-repository Git Synchronization window.
Local Branch, editable Remote Branch and Remote URL, Force, Outgoing Commits and
Outgoing Changes follow the source group order. Branch defaults use pull tracking
configuration independently of pushRemote/pushDefault/pushbranch. Selecting a
local branch reloads its tracking defaults. A detached HEAD still exposes the
local branch catalog so the user can select a branch. The local selector and
remote choices retain byte-distinct Unicode names rather than normalizing them.

The outgoing native table draws the existing colored graph before hash/message/
author/date columns. The changed-files tab shows Path, Extension, Status, Added
and Deleted, using original status artwork and appearance-aware status colors,
with original-icon comparison and unified-diff actions against the
pinned snapshot. Show Log and Commit use the captured repository and access
lease. Refresh replaces the outgoing snapshot and clears obsolete selection.

Each reload cancels its predecessor and checks identity before publishing. Close
invalidates owned reads; active comparison children and dirty editors guard
ordinary close. App Store reads require the retained repository grant. Quit
confirmation fences controls and comparison requests. Physical interaction,
complete source columns/context menus and displayed theme acceptance are pending.

## Verification scope

Five real-Git tests cover equal/ahead/missing/URL states, incoming and unchanged
results, pinned snapshots after a tracking reference moves, divergence/Force,
merge-base file scope, the unrelated working-copy fallback, copy identity,
205 outgoing commits, cancellation and invalid inputs. Staged/unstaged contents,
raw index and refs are preserved by the covered comparison cases. A sixth test
covers pull tracking versus push overrides, source ref-name stripping, missing
tracking configuration, detached HEAD, cancellation and byte-distinct packed refs.

The existing 15 revision-comparison regressions run alongside the new tests to
check the shared options change. Their fixtures use system Git; the five new tests
explicitly select the requested Git executable. No full-suite, transport, physical-input or signed-runtime acceptance claim
follows from them. The separate native verification covers only the outgoing
window controls/table/snapshot lifecycle; see the
[native QA record](qa/synchronization-window-2026-10-11.json).

## Remaining full port

- Remaining source layout: owned branch choosers, remote history saving/deletion,
  Manage, SSH-key controls, full tab control and status/progress.
- Incoming Log/changes, reference changes and conflict lists; complete outgoing
  columns/refs/sorting and context menus, persistence and light/dark acceptance.
- Pull/Fetch/Rebase/Fetch All/Remote Update/Prune/Compare Tags, Push/Tags/Notes,
  Submodule and Stash split actions, Apply/Email Patch, Show Log and Commit.
- Operation snapshots, live progress, cancellation, hooks, authentication,
  retained results, refresh, owner lifetimes and factory/app/Finder routing.
- Configured similarity thresholds beyond the pinned default, libgit2 route
  equivalence, external writers, physical accessibility and signed sandbox grants.
- Bare-repository app entry (currently disabled), signed Finder/App Store/distribution
  acceptance and complete application parity.
